What is true, is that they are a varied and inclusive collection of species, united in their belief that other galactic factions are far too focused on warfare, destruction and negative thoughts. The tribe dream of a future where different species all just get along, and reluctantly conclude that the only way this is going to become a reality is by the regrettable destruction of the backwards, unenlightened life forms that have not joined the tribe.""
