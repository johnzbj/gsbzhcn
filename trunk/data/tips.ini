0 = "Not all alien races are equal. Some of your opponents may have more effective shields, or better armor or maybe faster engines than you do. A fleet that wins against one race of enemies may not win against all of them."
1 = "Pay attention to weapon tracking speeds. The higher a turret's tracking speed, the more accurate it will be against fast moving enemies such as fighters. If necessary, you can use tractor beams to slow enemy ships."
2 = "Those small welding drones you see hovering around damaged ships are repair robots and indicate that the ship is attempting self-repair during battle. A ship taking constant damage will be unable to make use of auto-repair systems."
3 = "If your cruisers do not have effective short-range anti-fighter weapons you might consider adding a squadron of fighters to escort them, to prevent enemy fighters attacking them from within their shield bubbles."
4 = "Most weapons have a minimum range. Any closer than that and they cannot fire at all. Only a few smaller weapons can open fire close enough to fire from within an enemy ships shield bubble, and thus bypass shield defenses."
5 = "Not every part of space is the same. Some battles are fought nearby spatial anomalies that may affect shield strength or weapon ranges, which can have drastic effects on the tactics needed to win in battle."
6 = "Point-defense weapons are capable of firing at any missiles, not just those targeted at the firing ship. A screen of PD-enabled ships can screen your vulnerable ships from missile attacks."
7 = "Faster missiles are not just aesthetically different. The less time a missile is in transit, the less opportunity there is for it to be shot down by the enemy."
8 = "Combinations of different weapons are the key to taking down well-protected cruisers. Some weapons are good at shield penetration, others are good at armor penetration. Choose wisely."
9 = "Do not ignore the weight of ship modules. Heavier modules will slow your ships down, making them easier to hit, and slower to reach the heart of the battle."
10 = "Multiple shield modules on a single ship have diminishing returns. 'Stacking' a whole bunch of shields is not as effective as you might assume."
11 = "Some missiles have multiple deployable decoys which can tie up enemy anti-missile systems. Launch them from long range to ensure their decoys get a chance to deploy."
12 = "Not all ship hulls are equal. Many hulls come with built in bonuses such as more efficient power output, or stronger shielding. These bonuses apply to every module you add to the ship, so choose your ship hull wisely."
13 = "Did you know you can change the names of the ships in your fleet? Right click the icons on the deployment screen to see the option."
14 = "On larger battles, if you want to deploy a whole bunch of identical ships, you can right click a design and select 'mass deploy' which lets you place down a whole bunch of ships by just clicking the mouse."
15 = "If you use the same ship designs a lot, you might want to save out some 'default orders' for that design, which are automatically loaded to ships of that type. Right click an existing 'deployed' ship to do this."
16 = "If you want to see what your ship's weapons are up to mid-battle, click a ship to show its details. Each weapons module has a progress bar showing its reload progress, and a white dot represents if it has acquired a target."
17 = "You can see the current minimum and maximum ranges of a weapon mid battle by highlighting that ship, then clicking the specific module's icon."
18 = "Faster ships can be harder to hit, but ships will not automatically keep moving unless they are fighters or you explicitly add the 'keep moving' order to them."
19 = "You can see which ship is responsible for a communications message by clicking that ship's name on the communications window mid-battle. That centers your view on the relevant ship and filters messages to that ship."
20 = "You can toggle a friend/foe color overlay on the battle screen using the button at the bottom of the mini-map. This helps tell immediately who is on your side, and who is alien scum."
21 = "Try giving tractor beams to your anti-fighter ships. A fighter caught in a tractor beam is a sitting duck for weapons that have a short-enough minimum range."
22 = "You can guess how many repair-modules an enemy ship has, and their current state by looking at the repair-bots floating around ships damage. The more bots, the more repair modules they have."
23 = "You can center the battle screen map on the currently selected ship by clicking its image on the ship details window."
24 = "Repair modules will not last forever. Each module has a limited amount of supplies. You can see the current state of their supplies from the progress bar under their icons on the ship details window."
25 = "You can adjust the size of a fighter squadron by right clicking the deployed squadron and selecting 'Change Quantity',"
