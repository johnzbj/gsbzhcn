#,SHIPDESIGN2,Module Types,32,32,1,1,LaunchTutorial(SHIPDESIGN3);,,"Ships in GSB are made up of a hull, and a number of different modules. There are two types of module slots on a ship. A hexagonal turret slot can accept weapons turrets or normal modules. A square slot can only accept normal modules. This restricts the number of weapons each ship can carry. You can change the module in a slot by clicking and dragging it away, and then dragging a suitable module from the left hand module picker onto the appropriate slot."
