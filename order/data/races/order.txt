#description = "In the beginning of the universe, the one true god created the planets as home for the order, and plants as food for the order, and he created rivers from which the order would drink, and animals which the order would use as trusty steeds and faithful pets. Clearly all of creation is gods bounty for the order to make use of. As it happens, the one true god had not written in the holy book why he had created species from other worlds, so the order has assumed they were created for target practice. Any suggestion that they may have other uses is clearly heresy."
description = "宇宙之初，上帝创造了星球作为我们的家园，在星球上他创造了食物、饮水的河流、忠实的战马和忠诚的宠物。很明显，万物皆上帝所赐。然而，上帝并没有在圣经中说明他为何创造了一些异界的东西，所以也许它们是上帝练习神赐的产物。如果有人认为它们可以用作它途，那么很显然这将是一种旁门左道。"
