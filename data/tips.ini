[tips]
#0 = "Not all alien races are equal. Some of your opponents may have more effective shields, or better armor or maybe faster engines than you do. A fleet that wins against one race of enemies may not win against all of them."
0 = "并非所有外星种族的实力都是相当的。你的某些对手可能拥有更强效的护盾，或者更好的装甲也可能是引擎速度比你快。能够战胜某一敌对种族的战舰未必能战胜所有种族。"
#1 = "Pay attention to weapon tracking speeds. The higher a turret's tracking speed, the more accurate it will be against fast moving enemies such as fighters. If necessary, you can use tractor beams to slow enemy ships."
1 = "注意武器的追踪速度。炮塔的追踪速度越高，其对敌人高速单位比如战斗机的攻击准确度就越高，如果有必要，你还可以使用静止光束来减缓敌舰的速度。"
#2 = "Those small welding drones you see hovering around damaged ships are repair robots and indicate that the ship is attempting self-repair during battle. A ship taking constant damage will be unable to make use of auto-repair systems."
2 = "你所看到的那些盘旋在受损飞船周围的小型电焊无人机是一种维修机器人这也表示此飞船正在战斗中尝试自我修复。一艘受到持续伤害的飞船无法使用自动修复系统。"
#3 = "If your cruisers do not have effective short-range anti-fighter weapons you might consider adding a squadron of fighters to escort them, to prevent enemy fighters attacking them from within their shield bubbles."
3 = "如果你的巡洋舰还没有有效的短程反歼武器的话你或许可以考虑添加一支歼击机中队来保护它们，以防敌人的歼击机绕过护盾攻击巡洋舰。"
#4 = "Most weapons have a minimum range. Any closer than that and they cannot fire at all. Only a few smaller weapons can open fire close enough to fire from within an enemy ships shield bubble, and thus bypass shield defenses."
4 = "大多数武器都有最小射程。它们的火力完全无法覆盖更近的范围。只有少数小型武器能做到近距离从敌人护盾内部攻击，从而绕过护盾的防御。"
#5 = "Not every part of space is the same. Some battles are fought nearby spatial anomalies that may affect shield strength or weapon ranges, which can have drastic effects on the tactics needed to win in battle."
5 = "太空的每个角落并不完全一样。有些战斗发生在可能影响护盾强度或是武器射程的空间异常点上，这些异常点往往对战斗的胜负有着举足轻重的战略影响。"
#6 = "Point-defense weapons are capable of firing at any missiles, not just those targeted at the firing ship. A screen of PD-enabled ships can screen your vulnerable ships from missile attacks."
6 = "对点防御武器可以向任何飞弹开火，不仅仅限于被进攻飞船锁定的目标。开启点防的飞船屏障可以掩护使易受攻击的飞船免受飞弹的攻击。"
#7 = "Faster missiles are not just aesthetically different. The less time a missile is in transit, the less opportunity there is for it to be shot down by the enemy."
7 = "更高速的飞弹并非只有审美学上的差异。飞弹飞行的时间越短，它被敌人拦截的几率越低。"
#8 = "Combinations of different weapons are the key to taking down well-protected cruisers. Some weapons are good at shield penetration, others are good at armor penetration. Choose wisely."
8 = "不同类型的武器搭配是击败拥有良好防护的巡洋舰的关键。有些武器擅长穿透护盾，其余的则善于贯穿护甲。选择时动动脑筋。"
#9 = "Do not ignore the weight of ship modules. Heavier modules will slow your ships down, making them easier to hit, and slower to reach the heart of the battle."
9 = "不要忽视飞船模块的重量。沉重的模块会减缓你飞船的速度，使它们更容易被击中，而且到达战场中心的时间更久。"
#10 = "Multiple shield modules on a single ship have diminishing returns. 'Stacking' a whole bunch of shields is not as effective as you might assume."
10 = "在一艘飞船上使用多重护盾模块会造成收益递减。‘囤积’一大堆护盾可能并没有你想象的那么有效。"
#11 = "Some missiles have multiple deployable decoys which can tie up enemy anti-missile systems. Launch them from long range to ensure their decoys get a chance to deploy."
11 = "一些飞弹具有多重展开式诱饵可以消耗敌人的反导弹系统资源。远距离发射这种飞弹以便保证这些诱饵有机会展开。"
#12 = "Not all ship hulls are equal. Many hulls come with built in bonuses such as more efficient power output, or stronger shielding. These bonuses apply to every module you add to the ship, so choose your ship hull wisely."
12 = "各种船体也不尽相同。许多船体都具有额外加成，诸如高效输出功率，亦或是更强的护盾。这些奖励对每个添加到船上的模块都有效，因此要仔细选择你的飞船船体。"
#13 = "Did you know you can change the names of the ships in your fleet? Right click the icons on the deployment screen to see the option."
13 = "你知道你可以修改自己舰队中每艘飞船的名称么？右击部署视图上的图标可以查看该选项。"
#14 = "On larger battles, if you want to deploy a whole bunch of identical ships, you can right click a design and select 'mass deploy' which lets you place down a whole bunch of ships by just clicking the mouse."
14 = "在大规模战役中，如果你想要部署大量同型号飞船，你可以右击该设计并选择‘大规模部署’这样你只需点下鼠标就可以部署整队的飞船。"
#15 = "If you use the same ship designs a lot, you might want to save out some 'default orders' for that design, which are automatically loaded to ships of that type. Right click an existing 'deployed' ship to do this."
15 = "如果你频繁使用某一设计的飞船，你或许希望为那种设计保存一些‘默认指令’，它们会自动加载到该类型的飞船上。要这么做，右击一个已存在的‘已部署’飞船。"
#16 = "If you want to see what your ship's weapons are up to mid-battle, click a ship to show its details. Each weapons module has a progress bar showing its reload progress, and a white dot represents if it has acquired a target."
16 = "如果你想查看自己飞船的武器在战斗中都在做些什么，点击一艘飞船显示其详情。每个武器模块都有一个过程条显示着它们重新装填的过程，此外还有一个白色的圆点表示其是否已经获取目标。"
#17 = "You can see the current minimum and maximum ranges of a weapon mid battle by highlighting that ship, then clicking the specific module's icon."
17 = "你可以在战斗中查看某一武器当前的最小和最大射程，先高亮显示那艘飞船，然后点击特定模块的图标。"
#18 = "Faster ships can be harder to hit, but ships will not automatically keep moving unless they are fighters or you explicitly add the 'keep moving' order to them."
18 = "速度快的船或许更难被击中，但飞船并不会自动保持移动状态除非是战斗机或者你明确给它们添加了‘保持移动’的指令。"
#19 = "You can see which ship is responsible for a communications message by clicking that ship's name on the communications window mid-battle. That centers your view on the relevant ship and filters messages to that ship."
19 = "在战斗中你可以通过点击通信窗口中飞船的名字来查看那条通信讯息来自于哪艘飞船。那样做会使相关的飞船显示在视图中心并筛选出该飞船的讯息。"
#20 = "You can toggle a friend/foe color overlay on the battle screen using the button at the bottom of the mini-map. This helps tell immediately who is on your side, and who is alien scum."
20 = "你可以用小地图底部的按钮在战斗画面中以一种颜色标记友军/敌军。此功能可以马上告诉你谁跟你是一伙的，谁又是外星垃圾。"
#21 = "Try giving tractor beams to your anti-fighter ships. A fighter caught in a tractor beam is a sitting duck for weapons that have a short-enough minimum range."
21 = "试着给你的反歼飞船加上静止光束。只要你的某种武器最小射程足够近，被静止光束捕获的歼击机就是你的瓮中之鳖。"
#22 = "You can guess how many repair-modules an enemy ship has, and their current state by looking at the repair-bots floating around ships damage. The more bots, the more repair modules they have."
22 = "通过观察飞船损坏处盘旋的维修机器人你就能推测出敌人有多少维修模块，以及它们但当前的状态。机器人越多，说明他们的维修模块越多。"
#23 = "You can center the battle screen map on the currently selected ship by clicking its image on the ship details window."
23 = "通过点击飞船细节窗口中它的图像你可以将战斗画面的中心设置在当前所选飞船的位置。"
#24 = "Repair modules will not last forever. Each module has a limited amount of supplies. You can see the current state of their supplies from the progress bar under their icons on the ship details window."
24 = "维修模块不会一直工作。每个模块的补给都是有限的。你从飞船详情窗口的飞船图标下面的进度条中查看它们当前的补给状态。"
#25 = "You can adjust the size of a fighter squadron by right clicking the deployed squadron and selecting 'Change Quantity',"
25 = "右击已部署的歼击机中队然后选择‘改变数量’来调节歼击机中队的规模大小。"
